# Getting Started

## Pre-requisites

To work with Node.js, you must have version 18 or higher installed..

Check your Node.js version with the following command:

```sh
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in your current environment, or the installed version is too low, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install the latest version of Node.js.
